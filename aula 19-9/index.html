            <p>This boy golden retriever is unmistakable in his trademark brown beret. He has a laidback demeanor and loves the phrase 'let's go out!' He loves milk, anything soft, and his mama's cream caramel puddings. He has a talent for napping and doing 'purin aerobics', and can make friends with anyone. His dream is to get even bigger.</p>
